/**
 * A higher-order component displaying an opinionated list-detail format.
 *
 * The [list] slot is the primary content, and is in a parent relationship with the content
 * displayed in [detail].
 *
 * This relationship implies that different detail screens may be swapped out for each other, and
 * should be distinguished by passing a [detailKey] to control when a different detail is being
 * shown (to reset instance state.
 *
 * When there is enough space to display both list and detail, pass `true` to [showListAndDetail]
 * to show both the list and the detail at the same time. This content is displayed in a [TwoPane]
 * with the given [twoPaneStrategy].
 *
 * When there is not enough space to display both list and detail, which slot is displayed is based
 * on [isDetailOpen]. Internally, this state is changed in an opinionated way via [setIsDetailOpen].
 * For instance, when showing just the detail screen, a back button press will call
 * [setIsDetailOpen] passing `false`.
